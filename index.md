# Firebots Wiki

## Welcome to the Firebots Wiki!

This is where we can document useful information and knowledge we gather throughout each season. The hope is that over the years, we will be able to put together a collection of helpful tips that both new and experienced members alike can draw from.

Articles are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), specifically the [GitHub-flavored Markdown dialect](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github). This provides a simple syntax for formatting articles. The wiki itself is built on [MDwiki](https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md).

## Wiki Standards

* The first line of any article should be a title, marked with a # (e.g., # My Title Here).
* Filenames should match the title of the article, replacing any spaces with hyphens and making all letters lowercase, and should have the file extension `.md` (e.g., "Learn to Code" becomes "learn-to-code.md").
* All articles' Markdown syntax should be linted. Use the VS Code extension [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to help with this.
* If an article contains images, put them in a folder with the name `<article-filename>_images` in the same directory as the article itself (e.g., images used for an article called "Setting up a Development Environment" are stored in a folder called `setting-up-a-development-environment_images`).
