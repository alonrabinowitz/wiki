# Wiki Pushing Changes

1. After seeing your changes in your local copy and feeling good with them, save all of your changes.
2. Commit your changes and create a commit message to describe breifly what changes you just made.
3. Publish your branch and sync any changes.
4. Go to Github and create a pull request. Create a pull request title to describe what you want to merge.
5. Create your pull request and then you wait for your assigned reviewers to look  over your code and approve it. Make sure to resolve any comments they give!
6. Once the reviewer gives their approval, then you can merge your branch into main. 

Congrats, you did it!
